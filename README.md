# Word-Guess-Game -- Supernatural Style

A hangman-style game using words themed from the TV show "Supernatural."

User inputs a key (only letters are allowed, numbers will return an error message) and it is compared against the secret word. Word populates as more guesses are given. Wrong letters will decrease number of guesses left. 

When the word is correctly finished, it tallies a win. The correctly guessed word is diaplsyed along with an image related to the word.

If the user doesn't guess the word and chances run out, a losing image is displayed and a loss is tallied.
